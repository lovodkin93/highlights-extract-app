1. order paragraphs - empty line in between and different font. 
2. edit the openPage buttons to adjust to different window sizes (with the query). 
3. rewrite "oldHighlightStateHandler" in a more elegant way (w\o the "if else...." --> include the newValue inside filter condition).
4. when choosing spans - make an event lister that if onMouseUp occurs outside of text --> resets everything (probably through thr useEffect?).
