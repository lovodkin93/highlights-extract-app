1. lemma matching - also string similarity and different treatment to important words and non-important words.
2. organise the word-click handler to deal only with "REVISE HOVER"
3. order paragraphs - empty line in between and different font. 
4. edit the openPage buttons to adjust to different window sizes (with the query). 
5. rewrite "oldHighlightStateHandler" in a more elegant way (w\o the "if else...." --> include the newValue inside filter condition).
6. when choosing spans - make an event lister that if onMouseUp occurs outside of text --> resets everything (probably through thr useEffect?).
