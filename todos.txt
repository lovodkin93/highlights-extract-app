1. paragraph-clustering has bugs (the "Canadian" document --> quote is divided between two paragraphs).
2. bolding all always goes back to bolding span (and in revise hover - goes back to none)... fix this 
3. rewrite "oldHighlightStateHandler" in a more elegant way (w\o the "if else...." --> include the newValue inside filter condition).
4. when choosing spans - make an event lister that if onMouseUp occurs outside of text --> resets everything (probably through thr useEffect?).
