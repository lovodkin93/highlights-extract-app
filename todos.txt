1. fix the revision state (weird behaviour).
2. OnHover for revision state (only "REVISE HOVER").
4. lemma matching - also string similarity and different treatment to important words and non-important words.
4. order paragraphs - empty line in between and different font. 
5. edit the openPage buttons to adjust to different window sizes (with the query). 
6. rewrite "oldHighlightStateHandler" in a more elegant way (w\o the "if else...." --> include the newValue inside filter condition).
