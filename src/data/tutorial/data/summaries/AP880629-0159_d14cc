Two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters, each carrying a single pilot from the 50th Tactical Air Wing at Hahn, crashed and exploded at 1:30 P.M. today.
The aircraft crashed near a populated area south of Mainz, but no one on the ground was injured.
The crash came less than two hours after another F-16, this one from the 52nd Tactical Wing at Spangdahlen crashed into the Black Forest after that pilot ejected.
