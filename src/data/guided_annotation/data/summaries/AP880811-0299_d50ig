The Agriculture Department confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the Fall corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher retail food prices for months and years to come.
President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at helping drought-stricken farmers recover, while stating ``This bill isn't as good as rain,''.
Ewen M. Wilson, the department's chief economist, said that the United States might import some soybeans this year from countries like Brazil.
This drought could result in a 1 % increase in the food prices the coming year.
