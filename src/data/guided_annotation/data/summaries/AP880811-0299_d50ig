The Agriculture Department confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the Fall corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher retail food prices for months and years to come.
President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at helping drought-stricken farmers recover, while stating ``This bill isn't as good as rain,''.
Compared to 1987, corn production is down 34%, soybeans 23%, and wheat 1%.
Ewen M. Wilson, the Agriculture department's chief economist, said that the United States might import some soybeans this year from countries like Brazil.
